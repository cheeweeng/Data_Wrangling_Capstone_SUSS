### üõçÔ∏è Data Wrangling Project: Customer Satisfaction Analysis for a New Shopping Mall
This repository contains the code, SQL queries, and visualisation assets developed and submitted in April 2025 for the End-of-Course Assessment 
Data Wrangling at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS).   
The project focuses on processing, cleaning, transforming, and visualising survey data collected from mall visitors in 2024.  

## üéØ Project Objective
To clean, transform, and summarise mall visitor survey data, and provide a monthly summary of customer satisfaction indicators. 
The project tasks include:

1. Importing and storing raw survey data into MySQL
2. Cleaning inconsistent date formats
3. Optimising data types for efficient storage
4. Creating a summary table with monthly averages and derived KPIs
5. Visualising the data for business interpretation  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
Language: Python, SQL (MySQL), R   
Packages (R): DBI, RMySQL, ggplot2, dplyr, scales  
Tools: RStudio, MySQL Workbench, Jupyter Notebook  

## Codes Explained
1. Python script to access the dataset and store it as a MySQL table in MySQL database

2. MySQL statement to clean up inconsistent date format

<p>In this code, the <code>doi</code> column values have been updated to consistently use <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format.</p>

3. Alter Table statement to optimise data type for efficient storage

<p>For satis, confirm, ideal and handle, these four columns correspond to respondent‚Äôs rating on a scale of 1-10.
Therefore, using tinyint is space efficient (1 byte) and UNSIGNED restrict it to a non-negative value with a range of 0 to 255.</p>
<p>For comp, it has an input value of either 0 or 1, hence, using tinyint is also justified for saving storage space.</p>
<p>For nocomp, it has an input value from 1 to 4, hence it is optimal to use tinyint as data type to achieve space efficiency.</p>

4. MySQL statement to create summary table  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bce6ed6a-94b4-4a2b-912f-1c7075ce92ec" style="display: block; width:400;" />

A new table was created containing 12 rows, one for each month of the year, and 7 columns. The <code>mth</code> column contains an integer representing the month of the year.  
The satis, confirm, ideal, comp, handle columns contain the corresponding month average values for those variables.

5. R code to read in summary table and store it as an R data frame  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eca1561-e702-4267-bafb-293274e4b586" style="display: block; width: 450;" />

This R code read in the summary table and store it as an R data frame.

6. R code for visualization  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19f24de3-590e-4667-8651-0854c0cdb1cf" style="display: block; width: 450;" />

A single visual was created to make it easy for the mall manager to understand the information in the table.
